      I'm J, a 100% "working from home" full-time/contractor data and software engineer (Python, Node, Java, Kotlin) since 1998, born, raised, and living in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, available inside the timezone overlap from -8 UTC to +2 UTC. I have worked as a remote contractor for full-time English-speaking positions since 2020, including in the USA, Germany, Portugal, Angola, and Argentina.<br /> <br /> With a Big Data and Artificial Intelligence specialization at USP (2022-2023), a bachelor's degree in Computer Science (2001-2005), and a vocational school in Informatics (1998-2000), I'm a problem solver with experience as a senior back-end engineer, data, architecting, designing, and coding solutions with distributed systems in the cloud, like APIs, workers, ELTs (ETLs), queues, databases, leading teams, and mentoring developers since 2011.<br /> <br /> About culture: in my experience, the Spotify model and the "Five keys to a successful Google team" are reasonable definitions for a great culture. Factors like lean mentality, good practices (tests, SOLID, Clean Code), psychological safety, clarity, meaning, impact, dependability, accountability, autonomy, and responsibility are the best ways to make things work, deliver, and build a consistent team.
